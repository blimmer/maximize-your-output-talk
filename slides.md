### This talk is about

- Ways to **stay focused** and produce your best work :triumph:

- Leveraging the natural ebbs and flows in your productivity :wavy_dash:

- Self awareness while developing a story :point_right: :smile: :point_left:

### Coping Mechanisms

### Why Time Tracking?

---

### Data!
:bar_chart:

---

### Time Tracking Data

- What am I spending time on?

- Am I dedicating time appropriately between categories?

- Do I want to take the time to switch categories?

## Optimizing Story Work & Tasks

:pencil: :chart_with_upwards_trend:

---

## Optimizing Story Work & Tasks

- Planning
- Avoiding Rabbit Holes
- Asking for Help

---

### Planning

Think of two stories:

- one that you knocked out quickly
- one that took much longer than expected

What were some characteristics of the stories that took longer?

---

### Planning + Acceptance Criteria

Takes a good amount of time but, pays dividends during execution.

---

### Planning + Acceptance Criteria

- What, specifically, is in-scope
- What's out of scope
- Point or estimate work size (timebox)
- Leverage experience on the team

---

### Planning

> Planning takes too much time. I should be writing code.
> \- Everyone

---

### Planning + Time Tracking

Scenario:

- 1 hour planning once per sprint
- ((20 hours / week coding) * 2 week sprints)
- = **2%** of your coding time

---

### Planning + Time Tracking

Scenario:

- 2.5 hour planning once per sprint
- ((20 hours / week coding) * 2 week sprints)
- = **6%** of your coding time

---

### Planning + Reading Code

- Plan the approach **before** writing any code
- Much easier to parallelize options in your brain vs. in code
- Take notes!

---

### Writing Code + Rabbit Holes

![victimized](https://i.imgflip.com/31tee8.jpg)

---

### Writing Code + Rabbit Holes

- Awareness of time spent (time tracker)
- Questions to ask yourself

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 1

On this train of thought what __am I learning__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 1

On this train of thought what __am I learning__?

- Wat ...
  - why am I on this blog post!?
- Something needed to deliver the story ...
  - Have you learned enough to deliver the story?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 2

On this train of thought what __problem am I solving__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 2

On this train of thought what __problem am I solving__?

- Is it in the acceptance criteria?
- Do I need to solve it now?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 3

On this train of thought what __am I optimizing__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 3

On this train of thought what __am I optimizing__?

- Is it a valuable optimization?
- Is it too early to worry about this?

---

### Rabbit Hole Questions

On the train of thought what:

- am I learning?
- problem am I solving?
- am I optimizing?
