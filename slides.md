## Optimizing Story Work & Tasks

- Planning :pencil:
- Rabbit Holes :rabbit: :hole:
- Asking For Help :raising_hand: :question: :information_desk_person:

---

### Planning

Think of two stories:

- one that you executed against quickly
- one that took much longer than expected

What were some characteristics of the stories that took longer?

---

### Planning + Acceptance Criteria

Takes a good amount of time but, pays dividends during execution.

---

### Planning + Acceptance Criteria

- What, specifically, is in-scope
- What's out of scope
- Point or estimate work size
- Leverage experience on the team

---

### Planning

> Planning takes too much time. I should be writing code.
>
> \- Everyone

---

### Planning as a % of your time

Scenario:

- 1 hour planning once per sprint
- 20 hours per week coding * 2 week sprints
- = **2%** of your coding time

---

### Planning as a % of your time

Scenario:

- 2.5 hour planning once per sprint
- 20 hours per week coding * 2 week sprints
- = **6%** of your coding time

---

### Planning as a % of your time

- Take the time to get acceptance criteria locked in
- Alignment as a team
- :pray: Heather Daymon for enlightening me

---

### Planning + Reading Code

- Plan the approach **before** writing any code
- Much easier to parallelize options in your brain vs. in code
- Take notes!
- Start writing when you have a plan

---

### Rabbit Holes

![victimized](https://i.imgflip.com/31tee8.jpg)

---

### Rabbit Holes

- Questions to ask yourself
- Awareness of time spent

---

### Rabbit Hole Questions

On the train of thought what:

- am I learning?
- problem am I solving?
- am I optimizing?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 1

On this train of thought what __am I learning__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 1

On this train of thought what __am I learning__?

- Wat ...
  - how did I get to this blog post / wiki page?
- Something needed to deliver the story ...
  - Have you learned enough to deliver the story?
  - Is there more to learn later?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 2

On this train of thought what __problem am I solving__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 2

On this train of thought what __problem am I solving__?

- Is it in the acceptance criteria?
- Do I need to solve it now?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 3

On this train of thought what __am I optimizing__?

---

### Rabbit Hole Question 3

On this train of thought what __am I optimizing__?

- Is it a valuable optimization?
- Is it too early to worry about this?

---

### Rabbit Hole Questions

On the train of thought what:

- am I learning?
- problem am I solving?
- am I optimizing?

---

### Rabbit Holes + Time Tracking

> Wait, I've spent how many hours on this so far!?
> \- Me, in a rabbit hole

---

### Rabbit Holes + Time Tracking

- Data from time tracker invaluable
- Compare to team estimation - are you way off? why?
- Work to reduce your MTTD that you're in a rabbit hole
